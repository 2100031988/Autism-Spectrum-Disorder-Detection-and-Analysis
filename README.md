# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection and Analysis

This project aims to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning models. The dataset is processed, and a Random Forest Classifier is used to predict ASD based on features.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Contains a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis.
- `src/`: Contains modules for preprocessing, model training, and visualizations.
- `scripts/`: Contains the main script for training and evaluating the model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## How to Run

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
